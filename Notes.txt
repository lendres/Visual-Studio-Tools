1) Shorten DPTextCommands.Exec(...).
Is it possible to add a delegate type for text commands, make an array of delegates for the commands and then just use 
a loop in Exec to find the command name called and then invoke the delegate from the array.

2) Add images to the Outline toolbar buttons.  Would have to reinstall them everytime in Connect.

3) Move the adding of the commands (AddNamedCommand2 calls) to the DPTextCommands class as a function.  Call this function
from Connect.

4) Google examples of Visual Studio AddIns and look for an example of how to add a named command and then call it 
from a toolbar.  I'm going to go out on a limb and suggest the method currently used isn't really the best one.

5) In DPMenus.onListShortcutsInHTML adding a sorting feature and allow the output file to be specified.

6) Modify the formatting in the properties for C#.
	- In switch statements the body of case statements should be indented to the same level as the case statement
	  so that when I use {} the line up correctly.

7) Modify the class template to add "// End class" and "// End namespace."



To debug, ensure project settings start an external application:
Open the "Properties" of "Visual Studio Tools."
Select Debug->Start External Program and browse for devenv.exe in the C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio XX.X\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe

Go to:
C:\Users\lendres\Documents\Visual Studio 2012\AddIns
And change 

Add in location:
C:\Users\lendres\Documents\Visual Studio 2012\AddIns
D:\Documents and Settings\endrlana\My Documents\Visual Studio 2008\AddIns



Need to use the commandline switch: /resetaddin VisualStudioTools.Connect
To cause a reboot of the addin everytime.  Put it in the "Command line arguments:" box in the "Visual Studio
Tools" project settings.
